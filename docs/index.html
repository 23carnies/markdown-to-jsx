# This is Markdown

#### You can edit me!

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) lets you write content in a really natural way.

  * You can have lists, like this one
  * Make things **bold** or *italic*
  * Embed snippets of `code`
  * Create [links](/)
  * ...

<small>Sample content borrowed with thanks from [elm-markdown](http://elm-lang.org/examples/markdown) ❤️</small>

You can even include custom React components if you declare them in the "overrides" option.
